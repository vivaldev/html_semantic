## Header

A header is typically placed at the top of a webpage and often includes the *main title, subtitle, logo, and navigation*.

We write HTML (later in React, it's JSX but the concept is similar) inside the `body` tag. Everything visible happens inside the body of our app. So, we start by creating a header for our body, for example:

```html
<!-- ...other code above -->
<body>

	<header>
	  <div class="titles-logo-wrapper">
		<div class="title-wrapper">
			<h1 class="title">This is the main title</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">This is the subtitle</p>
		</div>
		<img 
		src="./images/BMW-logo.png" 
		alt="A logo of BMW the automobile manufacturer"
		title="BMW logo"
		width="30px"
		height="30px"
		 />
	  </div>
	<nav>
	  <ul class="nav-links-list">
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/about">About</a></li>
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>
	</header>
	
</body>
<!-- ...some code below -->

Here, there's a <header> that indicates this section is at the top of the page and includes important information. The most important element in this section is the <h1>, which is always the main title and usually contains the name of the site or business. There should only be one h1-tag in the entire project! This is semantically correct and helpful for visually impaired users. When they use a screen reader, it will announce when they're in the header section and read the main title. The subtitle isn't as important; I usually use a <p> tag, but you can use tags from <h4> to <h6> as well.

HTML offers seven heading tags: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. The semantic way of coding is to use, for instance, an <h3> tag for the article title and a "smaller" (higher number) heading tag for other titles within the article. For example, I often use the <h5> tag. However, you can't have an <h3> main title in an article and then use <h3> again for another title later in the text. That's bad for SEO!
<img />

The img tag itself is not semantically important, but its attributes are! Let's revisit my example:

html

	<img
	   src="./images/bmw-logo.png"
	   alt="A logo of BMW, the automobile manufacturer."
	   title="BMW logo"
	   width="30px"
	   height="30px"
	/>

    src: It's crucial that the src-path is clear and descriptive. There is a folder for 'images' and the file-name is the most important: it describes what it is. SEO appreciates this!
    alt: This is the most significant attribute concerning SEO because this is the text that a screen reader reads. This text also appears in place of the image if, for some reason, the image doesn't load. It's beneficial for users with slow internet connections who might have to wait for the image to load fully.

    [!NOTE]
    Rules for alt text, according to Chat-GPT-4

        Describe the Image: The primary purpose of alt text is to describe the content of an image to those who can't see it. So be descriptive and accurate.
        Keep it (relatively) short: Most screen readers cut off alt text at around 125 characters, so it's generally a good idea to keep it under this length.
        Don't start with "picture of" or "image of": Screen readers already announce the image, so it's redundant to include this in the alt text. Jump straight to the description.
        Use your keywords, but don’t keyword stuff: If it's natural to include a keyword you're targeting in your alt text, go for it. But don't include your keyword if it doesn't fit naturally.
        Don’t use alt text for decorative images: If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey any information, you can use an empty alt attribute (alt=""). This tells screen readers to skip over the image.
        Don't forget about image links: If an image is used as a link, make sure the alt text describes where the link goes.

    title: The title of the picture. This attribute also contributes to SEO.
    width & height: These attributes can be dealt with in the CSS file, but HTML also offers attributes for this purpose. I use them because images are often large, and this way, I can resize them before they appear.
