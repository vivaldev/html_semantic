`Header is always placed on the top of everything else. Usually Header includes *main title, subtitle, logo and Navigation*.

We write HTML (later in React it's JSX but similar) inside of the Body-tag. Everything visible happens inside the body of our app. So we start by making a head to our body, for example:

```html
// ...other code above
<body>

	<header>
	  <div class="titles-logo-wrapper">
		<div class="title-wrapper">
			<h1 class="title">This is the main title</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">This is the subtitle</p>
		</div>
		<img 
		src="./images/BMW-logo.png" 
		alt="A logo of BMX the automobile manufactorer"
		title="BMW logo"
		width="30px"
		height="30px"
		 />
	  </div>
	<nav>
	  <ul class="nav-links-list">
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/about">About</a></li>
	    <li class="nav-item"><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>
	</header>
	
</body>
// ...some code below

```

So, there's a `<header>` that marks that this code is on the top of the page and it includes "main info". The most important from those is `<h1>`-that tells that it's always the main title and usually includes the name of the site or business, whatever. **There can be only one h1-tag in the whole project!** That's semantic, that's easy for visually impaired (blind people) to understand when the use screen reader that reads out loud everything and when it sees header- or h1-tag, it tells that we're in header-section and this is the main title. Subtitle isn't that important, I just usually make it with p-tag, but h4-h7 would also be ok.

There are seven title tags in HTML: `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> and <h7>`. Semantic way of coding is to use for example h3-tag for article title and if there is other titles in the article later on, then you should use "smaller" (bigger number) h-tag, for example I use `<h5>`often for that. But you can't give an article first h3-main title and then use h3 again for title in the text later. That's bad for SEO!


### `<img />`

img-tag for itself is not semantically important but its **attributes** are! Let's look again of my example:

```html
	<img
	   src="./images/bmw-logo.png"
	   alt="A logo of BMW the automobile manufactorer."
	   title="BMW logo"
	   width="30px"
	   height="30px"
	/>
	```

 - **src:** It's actually important that src-path is clear and *descriptive*. There is a folder for 'images' and the **file-name** is the most important: it describes what it is. SEO likes!
 - **alt:** This is the most important attribute regarding of SEO, because this is the text that screen reader reads and this is also the text that appears to the place of img if for some reason img doesn't load. User may have shitty internet connection so it may take time to image load fully, but because of proper alt-text, user with shitty connection knows what his/her is waiting for. 
 
> [!attention]  Chat-GPT-4 about rules of `alt`-text
> 1. **Describe the Image**: The primary purpose of `alt` text is to describe the content of an image to those who can't see it. So be descriptive and accurate. For example, if there's an image of a dog catching a frisbee in a park, you can write it as `alt="A dog catching a frisbee in a park"`.   
>2. **Keep it (relatively) short**: Most screen readers cut off alt text at around 125 characters, so it's generally a good idea to keep it under this length.
>    
>3. **Don't start with "picture of" or "image of"**: Screen readers already announce the image, so it's redundant to include this in the alt text. Jump straight to the description.
>    
>4. **Use your keywords, but don’t keyword stuff**: If it's natural to include a keyword you're targeting in your `alt` text, go for it. But don't include your keyword if it doesn't fit naturally. Keyword stuffing can lead to a poor user experience and can harm your site's rankings.
>   
>5. **Don’t use alt text for decorative images**: If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey any information, you can use an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`). This tells screen readers to skip over the image.
>    
>6. **Don't forget about image links**: If an image is used as a link, make sure the `alt` text describes where the link goes.

 - **title:** Title of the picture, nothing more, but increases SEO points
 - **width & height:** These can be dealed in CSS-file, but HTML offers attributes too for this purpose. I use it just because usually images are huge and this way I can crop them smaller before they appear.`
