# Semantic HTML

In HTML, certain tags and attributes are considered "semantic". This term simply means that these elements convey a certain meaning or purpose. The significance of semantic elements lies in their ability to make the code easier to understand, which is particularly important for accessibility tools such as screen readers.

Below is an image that nicely encapsulates the concept of HTML semantics. On the left, you can see a website that uses semantic elements. On the right, you can see the same website, but this time, it uses only div elements. Quite a difference, isn't it? Using only div elements is not only semantically incorrect, but it also makes the code more difficult to read and understand - without even mentioning the accessibility issues, which we will discuss along the way as it goes very much hand in hand with semantics. 

Also, it's important to know that we're focusing only on the narrow scope of the topic 'semanctics', even just HTML semantics. There are other aspects of semantics, such as semantic CSS, semantic JavaScript, semantic SEO, and so on. There are over 100 semantic tags in HTML alone, so we will only cover the most common ones, starting with those illustrated in the image below.

Some developers primarily use div elements for their convenience and versatility. However, this approach can result in code that is more difficult to read and comprehend. Moreover, for screen readers, such code can be inscrutable.

## SEO and Semantic HTML

Semantic elements have a considerable impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). In other words, the more semantically correct your site is, the more favorably it is viewed by search engines like Google, enhancing its discoverability. On the contrary, websites that rely solely on non-semantic div elements tend to rank lower in search results. Thus, SEO is an important consideration for web developers.

## The Most Common Semantic Tags

Now let's take another look at the image above, focusing particularly on the example on the right. The most common semantic tags include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
