## Semantic HTML

In HTML, certain tags and attributes are considered "semantic". This term simply means that these elements convey a certain meaning or purpose. The significance of semantic elements lies in their ability to make the code easier to understand, which is particularly important for accessibility tools such as screen readers.

Below is an image that nicely encapsulates the concept of HTML semantics:

Some developers primarily use `div` elements for their convenience and versatility. However, this approach can result in code that is more difficult to read and comprehend. Moreover, for screen readers, such code can be inscrutable.

> **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**:
> Semantic elements have a considerable impact on SEO. In other words, the more semantically correct your site is, the more favorably it is viewed by search engines like Google, enhancing its discoverability. On the contrary, websites that rely solely on non-semantic `div` elements tend to rank lower in search results. Thus, SEO is an important consideration for web developers.
