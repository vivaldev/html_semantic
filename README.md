# HTML Semantics

A short guide to semantics of HTML.

## Description

I recently made a code review to a Linkedn associate and he had so much talent otherwise, but his main problem was 
that he used semantic tags like <section> and <nav> but in totally wrong places. He kindly asked me if I'd have any
resource about the subject so he can evolve. I did not have any, didn't know any good and beginner friendly source 
either, so I promised I'll try my best to share my limited understanding of the subject in a way I could think he
and other beginners would benefit.
